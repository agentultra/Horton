Horton - Grids for Humans
=========================

Horton is a library for making amusing things.  It provides a Grid
datastructure (*and various sub-classes thereof*) and some useful
modules and functions for doing neat things with them.  You can create
cellular automata simulations or you can generate mazes.  Grids are
very flexible and Horton gives them a nice, simple, *Pythonic* API.
What you do with them is left to your imagination.
